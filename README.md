Command Pattern Example
This is an example implementation of the command pattern in Java, using the classes Stock, Order, Broker, BuyStock, and SellStock.

How to run the code
To run the example code, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the project in your Java IDE of choice (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse).

Navigate to the Main class and run the program.

When the program is executed, it will create a Stock object representing a particular stock, and then create several Order objects that represent requests to buy or sell that stock. These orders are then encapsulated as BuyStock and SellStock commands, respectively, and passed to the Broker object, which acts as the invoker.

The Broker object then executes each command in turn, and the program outputs a log of the executed commands, along with the resulting changes to the stock's quantity.

How to use the code
To use the command pattern in your own code, you can follow the example set out in the Main class. First, you will need to define a set of commands that represent the actions that can be performed in your system (such as "buy stock", "sell stock", "cancel order", etc.).

You will also need to define the objects that will act as the invokers (such as the Broker class), and the objects that will receive and execute the commands (such as the Stock object).

Once you have defined your commands, invokers, and receivers, you can create instances of these objects and use them to execute commands in your system. By encapsulating the requests as commands, you gain the ability to undo and redo actions, as well as the ability to execute complex sequences of commands as a single transaction.

Conclusion
The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is commonly used in software applications to encapsulate requests as objects. This pattern provides a way to decouple a requester object from the object that performs the action, and allows for the creation of generic and reusable commands that can be executed and undone at a later time. In this way, the command pattern is useful in scenarios where there is a need for the ability to undo and redo operations, as well as for implementing transactional systems.
The command pattern is a powerful and flexible design pattern that can be used in a wide variety of scenarios, from text editors to home entertainment systems to transactional processing systems. By encapsulating requests as objects, the command pattern provides a way to decouple the requester from the object that performs the action, and allows for the creation of generic and reusable commands that can be executed and undone at a later time.
